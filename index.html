						</div>
							<h2>
								Environmental challenges are now considered a top priority for most nations worldwide. Climate change, pollution, forest fires, water quality and availability, 
								are among the many examples that are addressed by academic, governmental, and industrial institutions everywhere. Data science offers novel and unique opportunities to 
								understand and address many of these challenges, and has accordingly been receiving increased attention from various communities worldwide. Accordingly, the German University 
								in Cairo is organizing the winter school titled “Data Science For a Better Future”, which promises to bring together researchers and industry experts from Egypt and around the 
								world to discuss how data science can be used to address environmental challenges. The event hosts distinguished international keynote speakers and will feature workshops that 
								provide hands-on practical experience to those interested in learning the fundamental machine learning and data science concepts that can be used to address a number of 
								challenges. The event also contains a student showcase featuring examples of environmental issues that have been addressed using Machine Learning or Data Science. 
								The event also contains a hackathon to encourage the participants to innovate great solutions that could be used to solve our environmental problems. Participants in the 
								hackathon will learn to use Machine Learning tools in their solution. Want to join us in saving the world for a chance to win 3500$ in cash prizes?

								<p>Guc is established in cooperation with the State Universities of Ulm and Stuttgart, under the patronage of the Egyptian Ministry of Higher 
								Education, the Ministry of Science, Research and Arts, State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, and supported by the German Academic Exchange 
								Service ( daad ), the German Embassy in Cairo, the Arab/German Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( ahk ), the Federal Ministry of Education

                                        <h2>Cairo</h2>
                                        <p>Cairo (Arabic: al-Qahira) is the capital of Egypt and the largest city in the Arab World. Nicknamed "The City of a Thousand Minarets" for 
										its preponderance of Islamic architecture, Cairo has long been a center of the region's political and cultural life. Even before Cairo was 
										established in the tenth century, the land composing the present-day city was the site of national capitals whose remnants remain visible in 
										parts of Old Cairo. Cairo is also associated with Ancient Egypt due to its proximity to the Great Sphinx and the pyramids in nearby Giza.</p>
										<p>Egyptians today often refer to Cairo as Misr, the Arabic name for Egypt itself, emphasizing the city's continued role in Egyptian influence
										. Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industries in the Arab World, as well as the world's second-oldest institution of higher 
										learning, al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organizations have regional headquarters in the city, and the Arab 
										League has been based in Cairo for most of its existence.</p>
										<p>With a population of 6.8 million spread over 214 square kilometers (83 sq mi), Cairo is by far the largest city in Egypt. With an 
										additional ten million inhabitants just outside the city, Cairo resides at the center of the largest metropolitan area in Africa and the 
										eleventh-largest urban area in the world. Cairo, like many large cities in developing countries, suffers from high levels of pollution and 
										traffic, but its metro is currently the only on the African continent and also ranks among the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 700 
										million passenger rides annually.</p>
